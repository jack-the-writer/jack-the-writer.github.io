         <h1>Exiled for 21 years in Korea: Life of Chinese dissident Wu Zhenrong </h1>
         <p><img src="https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/newsV2/images/202302/3fef4d83fa8841c28f942151e196ae1d.jpg/dims/resize/740/optimize" alt="Wu sits on the floor of his 16-square-metre apartment as he sips a cup of coffee, a habit he took up since coming to South Korea."></p>
<p>Photo by Shim Hyun-chul.</p>
<p><em>Published on 23 February 2023 in <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2023/02/356_345948.html">The Korea Times</a></em></p>
<p>This long-form article profiles Wu Zhenrong, a Chinese man who was forced to leave China in 2002 for South Korea without his family. He had tried to publish a book about the Cultural Revolution. National security police intercepted a letter he wrote to the publisher and went looking for him.</p>
<p>The story describes Wu’s life, from being a boy growing up poor in the early days of communist China, to becoming a Red Guard, then a soldier and finally a low-profile democracy activist. He has spent more than 20 years in South Korea living on benefits and in a small flat without a toilet. Inside, he wrote essays about democracy in China that won’t be read by most of the Chinese public. Now at 73 years old, Wu pondered about death and his legacy.</p>
<p>I met Wu twice for an interview. I shadowed him with the photojournalist Shim Hyun-chul as he went about his day, visiting his home, neighbourhood and favourite Chinese restaurant in Seoul.</p>
<p>The details of his everyday life brought out his character and were essential to illustrating the thoughts and feelings of an ageing activist exiled from home.</p>
