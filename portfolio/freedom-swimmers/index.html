         <h1>‘Freedom swimmers’: They swam to Hong Kong in waters that promised death to escape a worse fate</h1>

<p><em>Published on 12 June 2022 as the cover story of the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3181180/freedom-swimmers-china-hong-kong-who-braved">South China Morning Post’s Post Magazine</a></em></p>
<p>I worked with the video journalist <a href="https://www.nadeemshad.com">Nadeem Shad</a> on this story about refugees who swam across treacherous waters to Hong Kong from mainland China after the Cultural Revolution. From the late 1950s and early 1980s, millions of them were estimated to have made their way to the former British colony at the risk of drowning, dying from hypothermia, being cut by oyster shells or being bitten by sharks.</p>
<p>We found and interviewed two swimmers, two former marine policemen and a villager whose family sheltered the refugees and gave them food when he was small.</p>
<p>We spent months trying to encourage the swimmers to speak to us and to reassure them that it would be safe. The experience of leaving mainland China was still traumatic to them. They were conscious that escaping to capitalist Hong Kong from the socialist mainland could be seen as betraying their motherland. They also feared that telling their stories to reporters might upset authorities in Hong Kong, where the political space was shrinking after the 2019 protests.</p>
<p>After Nadeem and I had finished our interviews, we collected newspaper clippings and archived policy documents about the waves of mainland Chinese refugees coming to Hong Kong after World War II. These materials were used to support their narratives in this long-form article and in a nine-minute companion <a href="https://www.scmp.com/video/hong-kong/3158912/freedom-swimmers-people-who-risked-it-all-flee-hong-kong">mini-documentary</a>.</p>
